% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section{Introduction}

Customer feedback is information provided by clients about their general experience
with a product or a service. In CEWE, one method to collect such feedback is asking
customers to complete online survey.

By collecting customer feedback, the extracted information can act as a guide to
improve products. Feedback gives the company the clue of customers' general experience
and the satisfaction rate. Except the description provided by sellers, the publicly
posted feedback is useful information to other consumers, imparting them an overview
how the product really is. This information also helps managers to make correct business
decisions.

The current way of processing user feedback requires that working staff reads the
feedback and later extracts topics. This process can be costly and inefficient,
because of manual intervention. At one time, people can only process a small batch of
text from a recent period. Thus, the information, which concerning long lasting but
less frequently appeared issues, may lost. This proposal will present a workflow,
which can extract topics from customer feedback without manual effort.

\section{Related Work}
\label{gen_inst}

Discovering “topics” from a collection of documents has been a long-standing problem
in natural language understanding. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) acts as the base of
recent topic models [2]. Hofmann proposed Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (pLSA) [3],
bringing topic models from deterministic to probabilistic. In 2003, Blei described Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) which is a Bayesian alternative to pLSA [1]. LDA makes use of
word co-occurrence information in documents, to generate document-topic distribution.
\todo[inline]{add oneline LDA}
\todo[inline]{cite distributed and multicore LDA}
However, the lack of word co-occurrence in short texts prevents LDA yielding satisfying
results [9]. Such short texts are news headlines, tweets, user feedback, questions and
answers, and so on. One strategy to overcome this data sparsity problem is to concatenate
a set of short texts according to available metadata [6, 7, 8]. For example, aggregating
texts by timestamps, locations or users. The evaluation plans for topic models include perplexity,
topic coherence, etc. [4, 5].

\section{Approach}
\label{headings}

Data preparation will be performed to filter useless information and concatenate entries of feedback according to their metadata. Afterwards a LDA model will be trained on previous customer feedback. Topic coherence will be picked to measure the function of the model.

The tools expected to be used and compared are Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Natural Language, Python spaCy, and Gensim. GCP Natural Language provides German support and offers easy to use APIs. Spacy also supports German and is highly optimized. It has very good interfaces with other machine learning libraries, such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn. Gensim is a python library which is highly efficient and scalable towards topic and semantic modelling.

Two obstacles are about to be solved. The feedback is written in German is one of the difficulties. Nowadays, many natural language processing libraries have poor support to German language. Either they cannot train models based on German, or they only provide limited features to German. The other difficulty is the variation of text is dramatic and unpredictable. This is reflected on two aspects. First, the quality of the feedback is varying. Some feedback contains totally useless information, such as "Nein", the copy of the survey email. The length of the feedback varies from one word to a long text containing hundreds of words. Second, the content of new feedback is unforeseeable. It may include new products, new services, etc.

For model deployment, the model will be retrained based on a time period. Outdated observations will be removed, and new observations will be included into the training process. This process can be scheduled using an ochestrator tool, such as Apache Airflow.

\subsection{System Pipeline}

Second level headings are lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
flush left, bold and in point size 10. One line space before the second level
heading and 1/2~line space after the second level heading.

\subsection{LDA Model Archetecture}

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third level headings are lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
flush left, bold and in point size 10. One line space before the third level
heading and 1/2~line space after the third level heading.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone, regardless of the formatter being used.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

Citations within the text should be numbered consecutively. The corresponding
number is to appear enclosed in square brackets, such as [1] or [2]-[5]. The
corresponding references are to be listed in the same order at the end of the
paper, in the \textbf{References} section. (Note: the standard
\textsc{Bib\TeX} style \texttt{unsrt} produces this.) As to the format of the
references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is used
consistently.

As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the
third person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4]'',
not ``In our previous work [4]''. If you cite your other papers that
are not widely available (e.g.\ a journal paper under review), use
anonymous author names in the citation, e.g.\ an author of the
form ``A.\ Anonymous''.


\subsection{Footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote} in the
text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches
(12~picas).\footnote{Sample of the second footnote}

\subsection{Figures}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
enough for purposes of reproduction; art work should not be
hand-drawn. The figure number and caption always appear after the
figure. Place one line space before the figure caption, and one line
space after the figure. The figure caption is lower case (except for
first word and proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.

Make sure the figure caption does not get separated from the figure.
Leave sufficient space to avoid splitting the figure and figure caption.

You may use color figures.
However, it is best for the
figure captions and the paper body to make sense if the paper is printed
either in black/white or in color.
\begin{figure}[ht]
   \begin{center}
      %\framebox[4.0in]{$\;$}
      \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
   \end{center}
   \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible. Do not use hand-drawn
tables. The table number and title always appear before the table. See
Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the table
title, and one line space after the table. The table title must be lower case
(except for first word and proper nouns); tables are numbered consecutively.

\begin{table}[t]
   \caption{Sample table title}
   \label{sample-table}
   \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{ll}
         \multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf PART} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf DESCRIPTION}
         \\ \hline \\
         Dendrite                     & Input terminal                      \\
         Axon                         & Output terminal                     \\
         Soma                         & Cell body (contains cell nucleus)   \\
      \end{tabular}
   \end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Final instructions}
Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.
In particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text
should fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
\textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
numbered.

\section{Preparing PostScript or PDF files}

Please prepare PostScript or PDF files with paper size ``US Letter'', and
not, for example, ``A4''. The -t
letter option on dvips will produce US Letter files.

Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must
only contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions
to achieve this.

\begin{itemize}

   \item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader,
         select the menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
         also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
         available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.

   \item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose fonts
         are also acceptable for NIPS. Please see
         \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}

   \item LaTeX users:

         \begin{itemize}

            \item Consider directly generating PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+
                  (especially if you are a MiKTeX user).
                  PDF figures must be substituted for EPS figures, however.

            \item Otherwise, please generate your PostScript and PDF files with the following commands:
                  \begin{verbatim} 
dvips mypaper.dvi -t letter -Ppdf -G0 -o mypaper.ps
ps2pdf mypaper.ps mypaper.pdf
\end{verbatim}

                  Check that the PDF files only contains Type 1 fonts.
                  %For the final version, please send us both the Postscript file and
                  %the PDF file. 

            \item xfig "patterned" shapes are implemented with
                  bitmap fonts.  Use "solid" shapes instead.
            \item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap
                  fonts.  You can try the equivalent AMS Fonts with command
                  \begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[psamsfonts]{amssymb}
\end{verbatim}
                  or use the following workaround for reals, natural and complex:
                  \begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
\newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers 
\newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}

            \item Sometimes the problematic fonts are used in figures
                  included in LaTeX files. The ghostscript program \verb+eps2eps+ is the simplest
                  way to clean such figures. For black and white figures, slightly better
                  results can be achieved with program \verb+potrace+.
         \end{itemize}
   \item MSWord and Windows users (via PDF file):
         \begin{itemize}
            \item Install the Microsoft Save as PDF Office 2007 Add-in from
                  \url{http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en\&familyid=4d951911-3e7e-4ae6-b059-a2e79ed87041}
            \item Select ``Save or Publish to PDF'' from the Office or File menu
         \end{itemize}
   \item MSWord and Mac OS X users (via PDF file):
         \begin{itemize}
            \item From the print menu, click the PDF drop-down box, and select ``Save
                  as PDF...''
         \end{itemize}
   \item MSWord and Windows users (via PS file):
         \begin{itemize}
            \item To create a new printer
                  on your computer, install the AdobePS printer driver and the Adobe Distiller PPD file from
                  \url{http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=204} {\it Note:} You must reboot your PC after installing the
                  AdobePS driver for it to take effect.
            \item To produce the ps file, select ``Print'' from the MS app, choose
                  the installed AdobePS printer, click on ``Properties'', click on ``Advanced.''
            \item Set ``TrueType Font'' to be ``Download as Softfont''
            \item Open the ``PostScript Options'' folder
            \item Select ``PostScript Output Option'' to be ``Optimize for Portability''
            \item Select ``TrueType Font Download Option'' to be ``Outline''
            \item Select ``Send PostScript Error Handler'' to be ``No''
            \item Click ``OK'' three times, print your file.
            \item Now, use Adobe Acrobat Distiller or ps2pdf to create a PDF file from
                  the PS file. In Acrobat, check the option ``Embed all fonts'' if
                  applicable.
         \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
If your file contains Type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will
ask you to fix it.

\subsection{Margins in LaTeX}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+
from the graphicx package. Always specify the figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below using .eps graphics
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ... 
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.eps} 
\end{verbatim}
or % Apr 2009 addition
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ... 
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf} 
\end{verbatim}
for .pdf graphics.
See section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation (\url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.ps})

A number of width problems arise when LaTeX cannot properly hyphenate a
line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command.
